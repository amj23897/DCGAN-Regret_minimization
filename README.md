# DCGAN-Regret_minimization

A Regret Minimization Approach to training Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network on MNIST Dataset. This was my Project of "Algorithms and Optimisation for Big Data" Course at "School of Engineering and Applied Science", Ahmedabad University.

Look at the "AOBD Final Project.pdf" and "AOBD Final Project.pptx" files for understanding about DCGAN and Regret Minimization and also for understanding my approach to this Project.

In this Project, I implemented Algorithm-1 from the Research Paper "Efficient Regret Minimization in
Non-Convex Games" of Elad Hazan, Karan Singh and Cyril Zhang.
